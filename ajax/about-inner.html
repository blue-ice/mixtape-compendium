	<h3 class="about-title">Have you ever listened to an audiocassette mixtape?</h3>

	<p class="about-text">Yes? Then you will understand the warmth, the humanity, and the vulnerability found in a small plastic casing that you can fit in the palm of your hand.</p>

	<p class="about-text">No? Then you have so much to look forward to: mixtapes are music playlists stolen from an era, but they are more than just relics- they are views into the recorder's mind. They provide a perfectly imperfect music listening experience, with a human touch and all of its associated human flaws.</p>

	<p class="about-text">This is what makes audiocassette mixtapes so interesting, and also so rare- the music that we find currently comes in playlists cooked up by computer algorithms. Why not listen to a playlist carefully composed by a human being?</p>

	<p class="about-text">What are you waiting for? <a class="about-link" onclick="document.getElementById('pick_title_box').click();">pick a mixtape</a> and put on those 90's headphones!</p>
